## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

### The run_analysis.R contains instruction to :
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### The script generates two files :
* tidy.csv : Data set with only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* tidy.mean.csv : Aggregate using mean for each activity and each subject.

### The data for the project is available at :
